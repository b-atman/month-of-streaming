# Culture Learnings — Day 1

## Spotify
### PART 1
- **Value — Autonomy with Alignment** Squads have the freedom to decide how they work, but align with company goals.

- **Way of working —** Small, cross-functional “squads” own features end-to-end; practices and standards spread organically via cross-pollination, not mandates. Work is organized in squads, tribes, chapters, and guilds for both speed and shared learning.

- **Surprise / Question:** Spotify doesn’t enforce “best practices” from the top — teams can choose their own tools and methods. How do they prevent chaos or duplication?

### PART 2
- **Fail Fast, Learn Fast — Mistakes are opportunities for learning, not blame.**

- **Way of working —** Teams celebrate experimentation, use “Fail Walls,” share postmortems, and rely on loosely coupled architecture to reduce risk. Frequent retrospectives drive continuous improvement. Learning is more important than being right the first time.

- **Surprise / Question:** Failures are publicly shared and discussed — how does this affect psychological safety and trust within teams?

## Netflix
- **Value — Freedom & Responsibility:** Empowerment and trust are core: employees get autonomy to make decisions and are trusted to act in the company’s best interests, while being held accountable for results.

- **Way of working —** Flat structure, few rules, and a focus on hiring only top talent (“stunning colleagues”). Managers act as coaches, feedback is candid, and context is shared so people can make informed choices. Employees manage their own time and resources, and Netflix invests heavily in transparency and open communication.

- **Surprise / Question:** Netflix lets go of “adequate” performers (not just underperformers), focusing relentlessly on maintaining a high-performance “dream team.” How does this approach affect team psychological safety and willingness to take risks?
